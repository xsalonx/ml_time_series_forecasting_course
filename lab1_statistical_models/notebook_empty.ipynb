More detailed information is published by other institutions, because they depend on the methodology used, e.g. core inflation [is calculated and published by the National Bank of Poland (NBP)](https://nbp.pl/statystyka-i-sprawozdawczosc/inflacja-bazowa/).\n",

There are also solutions for Kubernetes, both [open source](https://predictive-horizontal-pod-autoscaler.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) and [proprietary](https://keda.sh/blog/2022-02-09-predictkube-scaler/).

Basically every company has to do this, therefore even basic software like Excel or PowerBI have built-in capabilities for time series forecasting.\n",

Dataset has been gathered by the Italian scientists for [this paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0957417421005431?via%3Dihub). Data covers years 2014-2018, from 4 companies offering various pasta-based products. They also contain data about promotions for particular products. There are also missing values, which must be imputed.\n",
